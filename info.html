<h1>Aristocrats</h1>
<p>Aristocrats are an old type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher. Ciphers are a method of encryption slightly newer than codes. Substitution ciphers are ciphers where each letter is represented by another letter. Monoalphabetic indicates that each letter is represented by <b>exactly one</b> other letter. Because of these characteristics, the number of possible aristocrats is equal to 25 times 25 factorial. This is because there is another rule: a letter cannot represent itself. That makes only 25 possibilities for the first letter, 25 then for the letter that was chosen to represent the first letter, 24 for the letter chosen to represent the second letter, etc., etc. While this may seem like a ridiculously large number, it is computable by a modern computer, meaning that it can be brute forced (i.e. every single possible combination can be tried).</p>
